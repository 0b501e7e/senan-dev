This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Security maintenance (November 2026)

The existing Next.js site uses Next.js 15.5.29 and stable React/React DOM 19.3.1.
Keep `eslint-config-next` aligned with Next.js and use the committed lockfile with
`npm ci` for reproducible installs.

Next.js 15 pins an older PostCSS release. The scoped `overrides.next.postcss`
entry uses the project's patched PostCSS 8 dependency until the framework's
pinned dependency is updated. Do not remove it without running the audit again.

Validation commands:

```bash
npm ci
npm run build
npm audit --omit=dev
npm audit
```

At the time of this patch, the production audit reports zero vulnerabilities.
The full audit reports 18 moderate entries, all propagated from
[GHSA-g3hv-75wg-m249](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-g3hv-75wg-m249)
in the ESLint development dependency tree. The npm report currently marks
`minimatch <11.0.1`, while the upstream advisory lists `>=7.0.0 <11.0.1`.
The installed tooling includes both 3.x and 9.x. An indiscriminate override to
11.x would break tools expecting the 3.x callable export; the audit's suggested
ESLint downgrades are also unsuitable. Keep this finding visible and revisit
compatible upstream fixes. No audit exclusions have been added.

The patch must be deployed before it protects the public website. It does not
update the separate, unfinished Astro redesign.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
